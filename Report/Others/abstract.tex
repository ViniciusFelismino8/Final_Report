  The purpose of this report is to present the works developed during the outstanding period of the scholarship in robotics and autonomous systems. This opportunity arose through the program `` Novos Talentos - Robótica e Sistemas Autônomos'' offered by SENAI-CIMATEC in 2019 whose main objective was to develop differentiated human capital in the state of Bahia, seeking to increase the supply of labor qualified in the aforementioned skills. The work developed during the program period allowed to assign knowledge in the areas of mobile robotics and robotic manipulators and, consequently, provided the training of a Specialist in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
